# Modified Mingda Magician X firmware :)

These are my edits of the MMX firmware, enjoy.

## Support:
 - If you'd like to get help, suggest changes, or just generally discuss these modifications, you can join my Discord server here: https://discord.gg/e9fndmGUsY :)

## Edits and fixes:
 - Icons in print menu centered (moved one icon to the right)
 - PID_FUNCTIONAL_RANGE increased, as I had overshoot problems with the alloy hotend. (Eh, it still overshoots, but I don't really care anymore lol)
 - Languages added (Uncommented and fixed up) - cz, sk, cz2 (Czech, but more professional/literal/better translations, cz is kinda fun compared to this one)
   - changes in Marlin/src/lcd/extui/lib/tsc/Language/ to add a language
      - Language has to be included in Language.cpp
         - Check line 2648, which links to the language pack, which you create in Language.cpp too, copy a pack and change the language code before all the variables, vscode has got you covered, you can select all the variables and in the Ctrl+F find menu, you can tell it to replace within selection.
         - You then need to create the language file, it should be in the Language folder with all the other ones, and included in Language.cpp at the top.
      - You have to add it to the menu, see file Language.h from line 6, this enum list also determines the order the languages are cycled in the language settings button.
    - Status information moved to top of screen next to ready message to free up 2 icon spaces (toggleable, see Marlin/Configuration.h)
    - Added CFW version to info menu
 - Change long touch time in touch_process.cpp to not have to wait 3-5 business days in order to delete a file (not sure where else this might be used)
 - \+ there might be a few more, I try to add changes to the list when I make them
 
## Notes:
 - The firmware is by default set for the alloy hotend
    - To change the nozzle temperature limit back from 315 to 275°C, comment out line 41 in Marlin/Configuration.h
    ```
    #define USE_TI_CHOKE        // 加入钛合金喉管
    ```
    - Alternatively, to change the temperature limit, check lines 545 to 549 in Marlin/Configuration.h out:
    ```
    #ifdef USE_TI_CHOKE
    #define HEATER_0_MAXTEMP 315
    #else
    #define HEATER_0_MAXTEMP 275
    #endif
    ```
 - The firmwares in the ![releases](https://git.justleader.eu/justleader/mmx-marlin-custom/releases/) page have tags:
    - xx-yy where xx is the GD or ST version and yy is either ti for alloy hotend, or nm for normal
    - the tag can also be "multiple", if there are multiple types, in these cases, the files won't be named firmware.bin, but by their versions, as with the tags (xx-yy.bin), these must be renamed to firmware.bin before updating, or the printer will not acknowledge them.
 - The files for the GUI of the TFT screen are located at Marlin/src/lcd/extui/lib/tsc/Menu
 
## Installation:
 - Build the source, or download a build from the ![releases](https://git.justleader.eu/justleader/mmx-marlin-custom/releases/) page
 - If the .bin file isn't named firmware.bin already, rename it
 - Put the .bin file in the lowest folder of your portable storage
 - Put the storage into the printer and turn the printer on
 - Wait for the printer to update, you don't have to delete the firmware afterwards, as it gets renamed, but you can still delete the file after the update.
 - Done! You can now go check out some ![themes](https://git.jldr.eu/justleader/mmx-marlin-themes) too :)

## Building
 - build the same as a normal Marlin firmware, I use vscode with the PlatformIO extension, from where you can build the project using the "PlatformIO: Build" button in the bottom buttons list
 - to change the firmware type (GD or ST), comment the unsuitable type in platformio.ini, line 21 and 22, for example to enable GD:
 ```
 default_envs = langgo407ve_gd
; default_envs = langgo407ve_st
 ```
 
 
## Other customization
 - Ready message: line 210 in Marlin/Configuration.h
   ```
     #define CUSTOM_MACHINE_NAME "MD D301 F4"
   ```
- Changing version:
  - Version information is changed in Marlin/src/inc/Version.h
- Reverting to old main status screen
  - Uncomment `#define USEOLDSTATUSSCREEN` at the top in Marlin/Configuration.h, custom settings are at the top, before the Marlin configuration

## TODO
 - Try to fix weird font when Czech language
 - ~~Move printer status to top of default screen, instead of just showing ready message up there, freeing up two button spaces.~~
   - ~~Make optional when building manually~~
 - Add status message to in-print menu
 - When on info screen for a bit, Settings title appears, remove?
   - Meh, doesn't really matter
 - Screen dimming (probably only off/on) button on main page?
   - Screen auto off timer?
     - probably located in Menu/Settings
 - Add option to select type of leveling? (automatic bilinear/manual)
   - Probably only if the manual leveling menu already exists, I believe if does, but still
   - This might actually be the leveling menu in settings, gonna see
 - Make more modifications undoable?
   - Centering print menu icons
 - Add button to resume print after M600 pause when not printing from inserted media (ex. OctoPrint/USB)
   - Make menu for buttons like this one, probably on main screen where the space is free
    - When using old main status screen, place in Menu>Settings
   - Maybe add gcode to resume from terminal?
 - Add touchscreen calibration button to Menu>Settings, because when the icon is there, might as well
   - I guess do by finding function, or if cannot find, create reset.txt on inserted media (unlikely)
   - Remove reset.txt file from sdcard when screen calibrated
   - Icon actually doesn't seem to be saved to machine, add to updating function?
   - Change a variable and reset to calibrate on boot? If you don't begin the calibration fast enough when opened through the menu, it seems the machine crashes and just reboots
 - Add reset settings button somewhere
 - Add GCODE to manipulate all the settings currently only available on the touchscreen?
 - Make the language button open a list instead of cycling?
 - Skip storage selection menu when only one storage media type inserted?
   - show error when no media inserted and return to main menu

## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
